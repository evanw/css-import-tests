# `@import` tests

This is a collection of tests from https://github.com/romainmenke/css-import-tests. They have been reformatted as a single HTML page to make testing easier. To run these tests, serve this repository over port 8000 and then visit http://localhost:8000/full.html for the full set of tests and http://localhost:8000/subset.html for the bundler-specific subset of tests.
